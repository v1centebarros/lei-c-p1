 * \defgroup cppRobLink C++ interface for RobSock library
 * \brief C++ interface for RobSock library
 * \details 
 *   Set of functions that represents the default C interaction with the simulator.
 *   These functions are wrappers of the corresponding C++ equivalents.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_registering C++ RobSock registering functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Registering agent in simulator
 * \details
 *   An agent acts as a client in the simulation environment, being the simulator the server.<br/>
 *   So, it has to register into the simulator, before being able to control its robot.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_driving C++ RobSock driving functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Sending actuating orders to wheels
 * \details
 *   A robot is equipped with two parallel wheels, driven by two independent motors.<br/>
 *   An agent can control the desired velocity of every wheel.<br/>
 *   The possible values for the velocity range in interval [-0.15, +0.15], where a value of
 *   0.1 means that the wheel moves 0.1 units in one simulation cycle.<br/>
 *   The unit of lenght corresponds to the diameter of a robot.<br/>
 *   It is assumed that inertia and noise are presented, so the actual movement of the wheels can
 *   be different than the control values.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_synchronization C++ RobSock synchronization functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Wait for next simulator's data record
 * \details
 *   The simulator makes the state of the world evolve at every cycle, 
 *   which by default is set to 50ms.<br/>
 *   The agent needs to be synchronized with the simulator, in order to have updated information from the simulator.<br/>
 *   This update is done every time the agent calls the \c ReadSensors function.<br/>
 *   \c ReadSensors is a blocking function, that only returns after new data is received from the simulator.<br/>
 *   All information related to the last simulation step come in a single message and is cached locally.<br/>
 *   This means that all functions that return data (sensors, buttons, leds, time),
 *   just retrieve values cached in the last synchronization step.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_sensing C++ RobSock sensing functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Consulting sensor values
 * \details 
 *   After cycle synchronization (ReadSensors called), 
 *   the values of all available sensors are cached locally.
 *   The funcions in this group just retrieve values cached in the last synchronization step.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_leds C++ RobSock led manipulation functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Setting and getting the state of robot leds
 * \details 
 *   The setting actions are sent immediately to the simulator, 
 *   but only take effect at the next simulation step.
 *   Information from the simulator is only received through the \c ReadSensors call,
 *   being cached locally.
 *   So, the getting functions just retrieve values cached in the last synchronization step.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_buttons C++ RobSock button state functions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Get the state of the buttons
 * \details
 *   The robot body has 2 buttons that are manipulated only by the simulator.<br/>
 *   The \c start button is pressed by the simulator to start the run or to resume it after a stoppage.<br/>
 *   The \c stop button is pressed by the simulator to suspend the run in order to issue any required action,
 *   for instance, to remove a badly behaved robot. 
 *   Information from the simulator is only received through the \c ReadSensors call,
 *   being cached locally.
 *   So, these getting functions just retrieve values cached in the last synchronization step.
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_times C++ RobSock time funcions
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Get time
 * \details
 *   In general, in a challenge 3 times are defined: <br/>
 *   - \c final time, representing the overall time available for the run;<br/>
 *   - \c key time, representing the time until a first phase is completed;<br/>
 *   - \c cycle time, representing the time step at which simulation is done.<br/>
 *   These time are received at registering time and are cached locally.
 *   At every \c ReadSensors, the agent receives the current simulation time,
 *
 * \defgroup Cpp_config C++ RobSock configuration parameters
 * \ingroup cppRobLink
 * \brief Get parameters of current simulation
 * \details
 *   This parameters are received on registration and cached locally.
 *   The funcions in this group just retrieve values cached at that time.
